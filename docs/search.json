    "text": "Service to Our State and Beyond\n\n\nThe School Context Opportunity Score (SCOscore) is a measure of potentiality for learners in a school community. It is a composite score that combines multiple factors, particularly structural factors such as race and SES, as well as performance factors such as test scores and graduation pathway completion rates, to provide a more holistic view of school corporations.\nThe SCOscore was developed as method for identifying and prioritizing P-12 schools and school corporations for the Indiana University Indianapolis 2030 Strategic Plan. Specifically, SCOscore was developed for Goal 2 of the Service to Our State and Beyond Pillar: Engage State P-12 to Strengthen Education and Educational Pipelines in Indiana.\nThe SCOscore of a school corporation is calculated through the following:\n\\[\nS_{O} = \\frac{\\left[\\left(P_{urm} \\times 1.5\\right) + \\left(P_{frl} \\times 1.5\\right) + S_{ac}\\right]}{3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(S_{O}\\) is the SCOscore, \\(P_{urm}\\) is the proportion of underrepresented minority students, \\(P_{frl}\\) is the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced lunch, and \\(S_{ac}\\) is an academic achievement score for the school as a whole. The academic achievement score (\\(S_{ac}\\)) accounts for 3rd grade ELA proficiency, 6th grade math proficiency, and graduation pathways completion rates."

If a school corporation has an adjusted academic score above mean academic score + 1 standard deviation then adjust the non-white and free and reduced lunch percents to the state average if these are lower than the state mean. This gives some school corporations a little “bump” so that it cannot be said that any group is given an “unfair” advantage.
